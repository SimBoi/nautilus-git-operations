# Git Operations For Nautilus

An extension for Nautilus, adds an additional menu to the right-click menu for performing git operations on the current directory, operations include:
- clone
- status
- switch branch
- pull
- stage all and commit
- push
- set credentials

Check my [nautilus extension collection](https://github.com/SimBoi/nautilus-extension-collection).

#### Current Limitations

- Branches deleted on the remote still appear in the list and will cause errors when pulling or pushing.
